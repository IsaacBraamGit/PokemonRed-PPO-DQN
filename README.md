# Pokémon Red with PPO and a DQN battle subnetwork

## Overview

Welcome to the Pokémon Red Reinforcement Learning Project! Our goal is to advance AI gameplay in the classic 1996 Pokémon Red video game using cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. This project is a work in progress, focusing on enhancing the strategic depth an AI can achieve within the game's complex decision-making environment. We are building upon the foundational work of using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for game navigation and battling, addressing its limitations by integrating a tailored Deep Q-Network (DQN) specifically for battle sequences.

## Current Capabilities

Our approach combines the exploration and navigation capabilities of PPO with the strategic battle acumen of DQN to significantly improve AI performance in Pokémon battles. The integration aims at:

- Navigating the game world efficiently with PPO, utilizing pixel data for movement and basic interactions.
- Engaging in battles with a more strategic depth through a DQN, designed to understand and exploit the intricacies of Pokémon battles, such as type advantages, move sets, and Pokémon stats.
- Overcoming the limitations of relying solely on pixel data for battle decisions, allowing the AI to develop more complex and effective battle strategies.

## Objectives

Our vision extends beyond merely playing Pokémon Red. We aim to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in gaming environments characterized by high-dimensional state spaces and complex, rule-based interactions. Specifically, we are interested in:

- Demonstrating the potential of combining different RL techniques to tackle various aspects of complex games.
- Exploring the strategic depth that AI can reach in environments with incomplete information and significant randomness.
- Applying insights gained from this project to other domains requiring sophisticated decision-making under uncertainty, such as financial risk management and robotics.
